Cards: Param_card.dat has the stau mass and gravitino mass set as 100 GeV and 1 keV each.
Neutralino mass and mixing is set a arbitrarily. I changed the mass of lightest neutralino and the NMix has been taken directly from Teresa's SLHA file.

Set the susy breaking scale as 1000 GeV
tan beta = 15
added a block for sgn(mu)

set the decay of stau to a gravitino and a tau - 100% BR
and set the lifetime arbitrarily as well.

Delphes card:
1. FCC-ee did not work- need to be checked
2. ILD works-output saved in output_delphesILD.root 

Number of muons, electrons, and jets look reasonable.
